## About Me

I am a highly skilled researcher and professional with over 14 years of experience in software development and Artificial
Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and data analytics. I have led and contributed to a wide range of projects, from
agile development teams to large-scale international collaborations, holding roles such as Tech Lead, AI/ML specialist,
Data Scientist, and Software Engineer. I am particularly drawn to unsupervised learning and exploratory data analysis.
